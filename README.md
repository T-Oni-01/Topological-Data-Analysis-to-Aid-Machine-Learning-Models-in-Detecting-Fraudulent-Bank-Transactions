UNF Spring 2025 Direct Independent Study (DIS)

This is a DIS I undertook at the University of North Florida In the Spring of 2025, investigating the topic "Topological Data Analysis to Aid Machine Learning Models in Detecting Fraudulent Bank Transactions"

Professor: Dr. Karthikeyan Umapathy

Abstract:
This research plan aims to investigate the use of
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in detecting financial scams.
Conventional fraud detection techniques find difficulty in iden-
tifying convoluted patterns in transaction data which results in
individual and organizational loss in finances. This study offers
an evaluation of the effectiveness of TDA as a new approach to
locating hidden abnormalities that would be a sign of fraudulent
activities, comparing its performance to traditional machine
learning models. By using publicly available financial transaction
data, this research will explore how TDA can enhance detection
precision as well as reduce the number of false positives thus
contributing needed insight and improving financial security in
an ever-growing financial landscape
